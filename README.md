This is a simple problem generation framework for ACM/ICPC competitions.

What you need to do is write the generator.cc file and compile it into .o file.
`make all` will build the generator with your generator.cc file and `make generate_all`
will generate 100 test cases in `data` folder(the data count and data folder is defined
in `Makefile`).
